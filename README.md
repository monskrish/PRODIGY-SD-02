A simple Python-based guessing game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback after each guess (e.g., "Too high" or "Too low") and keeps track of the number of attempts. Perfect for beginners learning Python basics like loops, conditional statements, and user input handling.
